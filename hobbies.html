      <h2>Choir</h2>
      <p>My involvement in the AHS choir program has been more than most can say about any program. I have been singing for longer than nearly anyone at my school, starting at age 2 1/2. I've made it to the highest level a high schooler can make it to for school-connected competition, which is the Texas All State Choir. I have been accepted in the National Honor Choir for the major American Choral Directors Association conference three times, and have had countless opportunities to show my determination, focus, and my skill over the years of my career. Choir is the reason I am so well connected in high school, and also a major eye catching point for prospecting colleges in the future. Choir will forever have a special place in my heart and soul.</p>

      <h2>Band</h2>
      <p>Band has been a huge part of my life since 4th grade, when I got the chance to hear the professer of oboe at UT Austin play for a recital. I immediately knew I wanted to play oboe, and in 6th grade I was given that chance. Now, I am in the top band of Austin High School, and have been for my entire high school career. I also participate in Marching Band, where I play in the pit. I have made so many friends and memories that I will always cherish because of band.</p>

    <div class="hobbies-section">
      <h2>Theatre</h2>
      <p>I've been an actor since first grade, when my mother let me be in the muscial that she put on at my elementary school every year. Ever since, I always proudly say that I am an actor, and have been extremely fortunate to have gotten roles that most could only dream of. I was the boy soloist in the 'Bernstein Mass' at the Long Center in Austin in 2018. I was only in 4th grade. Another amazing opportunity I have had every year was to be cast as a lead in the Summer Theater Series for AISD. I played Sonny for 'In the Heights', Pepper in 'Mamma Mia', Lucas in 'The Addams Family', and Bert in 'Mary Poppins'. Theater always has and will be a major part of my life.</p>

    <div class="hobbies-section">
      <h2>Baseball</h2>
      <p>My father introduced me to baseball when I was 3 years old. I've never gone a single year without it since. There's something electrifying, being on the field, and I always love stepping out onto the pitching mound, ready to give it my all. Baseball is such a huge part of my life, and I would not be the same person I am today without it.</p>
